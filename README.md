## What is `The ALIAS Maker Project`?
`The ALIAS Maker Project` is a project started by Jack Koskie for air traffic controllers (ATC) on the [Vatsim Network](https://www.vatsim.net). The actual ALIAS maker is just a simple batch (.bat) file that will just make a simle text (.txt) file that [Euroscope](http://www.euroscope.hu) can read...

Ok maybe thats too simple. Lets Break it down a bit.

## What is Vatsim?
[Vatsim](https://www.vatsim.net) stands for Virtual, Air, Traffic, Simulation, Network, and is a huge community of *virtual* Pilots and *virtual* air traffic controllers. The pilots run their sim and connect using a client like [vPilot](https://vpilot.metacraft.com/). The air traffic controllers connect using a controller scope like [Euroscope](http://euroscope.hu).

## What is an ALIAS file?
An ALIAS file is a simple text (.txt) file that allows controlers to use simple commands that all start with dots (.) to write out long sentances to use to communicate with pilots that are text only.

## Disclamer
The ALIAS Maker Project is designed to only be used with flight _simulation_.
